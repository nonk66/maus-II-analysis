    <h3>Page 27, Panel 6</h3>

    <p>The panel is a landscape scene taller than it is wide, and shows the controlled chaos of Auschwitz. Although it is the only real action in the scene, it’s not the main focus of the panel – more than half of the space is used solely to show the smoke from an incinerator looming over the prisoners. By focusing on this symbol of death over the clash below, the panel emphasizes the pointlessness of fighting for the prisoners – no matter what they do, they cannot save themselves from the gas. The smoke’s position above the prisoners also indicates a power hierarchy, with the smoke - and with it, death - trumping all efforts to escape. </p>
