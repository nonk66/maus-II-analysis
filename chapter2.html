    <p>In this panel, Art sits on a mountain of Jewish corpses as reporters and entrepreneurs approach him with questions and business offers. Instead of being portrayed as animals, all the people are shown as humans wearing animal masks. This could show that the encroaching people only pretend to be working for some greater good – represented by their country – and are really just working for themselves. As they walk over the bodies, their focus is only on Art, showing their disregard and lack of respect for actual stories of the Holocaust. Art also being shown wearing a mouse mask could indicate that he feels the same way about him writing Maus - not doing justice the experiences of Jews in the Holocaust, or feeling guilty about profiting off such a topic. </p>
