    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>

    <p>The panel takes up the width of the page while Vladek talks about the young girls being hanged. Although the panel is set in the present, with Vladek telling the story instead of living it, we see the hanging legs of the girls behind them. This superposition of the past onto the present represents that although the Holocaust has been over for forty years, it still affects Vladekâ€™s daily life up until his death. He vividly remembers small, gruesome details, and can visualize them perfectly alongside reality. The hanging girls being behind the car could represent how Vladek is still ahead of his past, still functioning, but not far ahead; he can never fully escape it. </p>
