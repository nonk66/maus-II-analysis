    <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
    <h3>Page 115, Panel ~7</h3>

    <p>The panel is covered by photographs of people Vladek knew. They aren’t restricted to the panel, though, they’re just strewn over it. This positioning could be portraying them as their own individual panels. They’re their own moments in time, their own scenes, just as other panels are. Their disorder could represent how many untold stories exist – though Maus became extremely popular, it isn’t special, or different; each person in each photograph laid on the page represents another real human life affected by the Holocaust, another entire Maus to be written and read. The problem is that nobody has the mental capacity to truly empathize with six million Vladek Spiegelmans. </p>
