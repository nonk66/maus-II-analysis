    <p>Vladek and Anja embrace, backed by a white circle on a completely black background. From the previous panels, we know there are others around them, but they’re not shown. The complete focus on Vladek and Anja and complete removal of their surroundings shows how much they mean to each other, and how little everything else means to them. Many times throughout the story, Vladek’s hope of seeing Anja again was the only thing keeping him from giving up. Even if he knew he could survive and see the others in the scene, it’s likely he wouldn’t care if he knew Anja would not be there – the panel’s sole focus on them shows that their relationship is pretty much the only thing that matters, at least in that moment. </p>
